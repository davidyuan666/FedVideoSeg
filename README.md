# FedVideoSeg: Federated Learning for Educational Video Segment Localization

FedVideoSeg is a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that combines three key technologies:
1. **Large Language Models** (DeepSeek) for semantic video segment evaluation
2. **Federated Learning** for collaborative training across heterogeneous devices
3. **Binary Search Video Localization** for efficient question-relevant segment finding

## 🔥 Key Features

- **Binary Search Localization**: Reduces video processing complexity from O(T) to O(log T)
- **Device-Aware Federated Learning**: Supports mobile, desktop, and server devices with adaptive compression
- **Privacy Protection**: Local data processing with differential privacy options
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Dynamic attention mechanism combining visual, audio, and text information
- **Real-time Performance**: <45ms inference latency across all device types

## 📊 Performance Highlights

- **87.3% QA Accuracy** (14.2% improvement over centralized baselines)
- **75% Reduction** in video processing time through binary search
- **12.8% Improvement** from cross-device collaboration vs single-device training
- **92.1% Segment Localization Accuracy** with DeepSeek-enhanced relevance scoring

## 🏗️ Architecture


## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CUDA Out of Memory**
   ```bash
   # Reduce batch size
   python train_qwen.py --batch_size 1
   ```

2. **Missing Video Files**
   ```bash
   # Check video directory
   ls dataset/video/
   ```

3. **Privacy Budget Exhausted**
   ```bash
   # Increase noise multiplier or reduce training rounds
   python federated_train.py --noise_multiplier 2.0 --num_rounds 2
   ```

### Performance Optimization

- **GPU Memory**: Use `--batch_size 1` for 8GB GPUs
- **Training Speed**: Enable `--use_lora` for faster convergence
- **Privacy-Utility Trade-off**: Adjust `--noise_multiplier` (lower = less privacy, better utility)

## 📊 Monitoring Training

Training logs and metrics are saved to:
- `output/training_logs/` - Training progress
- `output/models/` - Saved model checkpoints
- `output/privacy_reports/` - Differential privacy analysis
