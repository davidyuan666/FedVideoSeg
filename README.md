# FedVideoQA: A Federated Multimodal Framework for Video Question Answering

FedVideoQA is a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that combines three key technologies:
1. **Large Language Models** (DeepSeek) for semantic video segment evaluation
2. **Federated Learning** for collaborative training across heterogeneous devices
3. **Binary Search Video Localization** for efficient question-relevant segment finding

## 🔥 Key Features

- **Binary Search Localization**: Reduces video processing complexity from O(T) to O(log T)
- **Device-Aware Federated Learning**: Supports mobile, desktop, and server devices with adaptive compression
- **Privacy Protection**: Local data processing with differential privacy options
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Dynamic attention mechanism combining visual, audio, and text information
- **Real-time Performance**: <45ms inference latency across all device types

## 📊 Performance Highlights

- **87.3% QA Accuracy** (14.2% improvement over centralized baselines)
- **75% Reduction** in video processing time through binary search
- **12.8% Improvement** from cross-device collaboration vs single-device training
- **92.1% Segment Localization Accuracy** with DeepSeek-enhanced relevance scoring
